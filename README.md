# CapstoneComicData

-------------------
ALL FILES HAVE TO BE PLACED INTO THE SAME FOLDER!!!
-------------------

-------------------
THE WORKING DIRECTORY IN R-STUDIO HAS TO BE SET TO THIS FOLDER! 
(in R Studio after opening the file via Session --> Set Working Directory -->To Source File Location)
-------------------

This repository contains

THE R FILE TO DO THE ANALYSIS
- the file with the full analysis "Capstone_Comicdata.R"

THE DATA (OPTIONALLY)
- the full data file "data_comics.RData" has been downloaded and stored before. (This download is optional, by default the data is downloaded in the given files. See comments how to use this)

THE WRITTEN REPORT
- the report as pdf file "CapstoneProject_Comicdata_Markdown.pdf"
- the RMarkdown File "CapstoneProject_Comicdata_Markdown.Rmd"
- the bibliography file "bibliography.bib" (which contains the bibliography data for the RMarkddown file)
- the bibliography style file  "ieee.csl" (which defines the style of the bibliography of the RMarkdown file)

The RMarkdown file needs the files bibliography.bib and the corresponding style ieee.csl to work and show the correct citations.

The R file and the RMarkdown file download the data as given in the R documentation. This takes a while each time you run the skript. This can be sped up by using the pre-stord datafile. There are comments in the code to explain how to do this.
