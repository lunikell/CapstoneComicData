Once the significance level is determined with χ2, Cramer's V can be used to measure the strength of association. Values for the maximum possible χ2 are given for six nonparametric tests in order to facilitate the computation of an extension of V denoted as V′. An example is given where V′ is applied to a one-way analysis of variance test for ranked data.}",
